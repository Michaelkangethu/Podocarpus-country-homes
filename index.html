    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
Podocarpus cottages are the perfect destination for anyone who wants to escape
 the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoy a serene and relaxing vacation in the heart of nature.
These cottages are situated on the eastern side of Mt Kenya, the second highest mountain in Africa 
and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The cottages are surrounded by lush greenery and offer a panoramic
view of the mountain and the forest. You can wake up to the sound of birds singing and the sight of
 monkeys playing in the trees. You can also admire the spectacular sunrise and sunset over the mountain from your cottage window or balcony.

The cottages are spacious and well-equipped with modern amenities, such as Wi-Fi,
 TV, hot water, and kitchen facilities. You can also enjoy delicious meals prepared 
 with fresh ingredients from the local farms and markets. The staff are friendly and helpful, 
 and will make you feel at home. You can also interact with other guests and share your experiences and stories.

One of the main attractions of Podocarpus cottages is their proximity to Mt Kenya National park,
 which is only 200 metres away. The park covers an area of over 700 square kilometres and hosts 
 a variety of flora and fauna, including elephants, buffaloes, leopards, zebras, antelopes, hyenas, 
 and many more. The park also has several hiking trails that cater to different levels of difficulty 
 and duration. You can choose to take a half day hike to the forest zone, where you can see exotic plants, 
 waterfalls, and caves. Or you can opt for a full day hike to the alpine zone, where you can see glaciers,
  lakes, and rocky peaks. If you are feeling adventurous, you can also join a guided expedition to climb 
  
  to the summit of Mt Kenya, which stands at 5,199 metres above sea level. The climb takes about four to 
  six days, depending on the route and the weather conditions. It is a challenging but rewarding 
  experience that will give you a sense of achievement and awe.

Podocarpus cottages are also an ideal base for exploring the surrounding animal conservancies, 
such as Ol Pajeta, which is about 40 kilometres away. Ol Pajeta is one of the largest and most 
successful wildlife sanctuaries in Kenya, and home to the last two northern white rhinos in the world. 
You can also see other endangered species, such as black rhinos, Grevy's zebras, and chimpanzees.
 You can take a game drive or a guided walk through the conservancy and learn more about the conservation 
 efforts and challenges. You can also visit the Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary, which provides a 
 safe haven for rescued chimpanzees from across Africa.

Another place worth visiting is the Maumau caves, which are about 20 kilometres away from Podocarpus 
cottages. These caves are of historical significance, as they were used by the Maumau fighters during
 their struggle for independence from British colonial rule in the 1950s. The caves have been preserved 
 as a national monument and a museum, where you can see artifacts, photos, and documents that tell th
 e story of the Maumau movement and its heroes.

If you are a bird lover, you will be amazed by the diversity of birds that inhabit the area around
 Podocarpus cottages. There are over 300 species of birds that have been recorded in Mt Kenya National park alone,
  ranging from tiny sunbirds to majestic eagles. You can also see rare and endemic birds, such as the Jackson's f
  rancolin, the Abbott's starling, and the Sharpe's longclaw. You can take a birdwatching tour with an expert 
  guide who will help you identify and appreciate these feathered beauties.

Podocarpus cottages are more than just a place to stay, they are your home away from home. 
They offer you a unique opportunity to experience nature at its best, as well as learn about
 the culture and history of Kenya. Whether you are looking for adventure or relaxation, 
 you will find it at Podocarpus cottages.
